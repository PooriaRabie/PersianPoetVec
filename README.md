# PersianPoetVec
PersianPoetVec: A Word2Vec model trained on the complete works of Saadi, Hafez, and Rumi (Masnavi and Diwan-e Shams). Using Gensim, this project creates embeddings that capture the unique semantics of classical Persian poetry, allowing for insightful comparisons with Googleâ€™s 2013 Word2Vec model.
